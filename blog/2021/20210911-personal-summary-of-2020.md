# Personal summary of 2020

It looks weird to write my summary of the past 2020, but when I told you that I quit my job and start my start-up business at the end of 2020, it all makes sense now.

The reason I quit my job was somewhat complicated. It combined my ambition and the disappointment of the company that I worked for 15 years. And I deeply agree on the judgements:

> You'll join a company because of the bright future described by the founder of the company, but you would leave the company only when your immediate leader failed to fulfill the promise.

I feel that I lay down the burden suddenly when I walked out the company's gate. I've no idea the road I choose is right or wrong, the only thing that I know is: I'll regret if I don't take action.

To be, or not to be, it's a question.
