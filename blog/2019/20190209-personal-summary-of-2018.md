# Personal summary of 2018

Woo, how time flies, it's already 2019 now. I spent too much time on some specific projects last year, but the outcome is too little to help me to reach the planned achievement. And I've learned from the experiences that not what you've done matters, but the stories you told to the decision makers matter. 
During the second half of the year, the high-level business strategy is more clear: find the dominant partners and marketing with them. So regions are assigned to directors who are responsible for implementing the policy in those regions. 
In 2019, the sector responsibilities are narrowed to "Proposing solutions for particular businesses" and will not spend time on giving the general solutions to potential customers. Hope it works for me.
Wish me luck in the last year of the VAM (valuation adjustment mechanism) and have a good return.
