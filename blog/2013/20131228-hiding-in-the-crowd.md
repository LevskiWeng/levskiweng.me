# Hiding in the crowd

At some point, the parks and open public places in Mainland China are occupied by a lot of middle-aged men and women during 7:00 A.M. – 9:00 A.M., 7:00 P.M. – 10:00 P.M. and they dance with really loud music. I have to pass by the crowd on my way to the office every workday. I notice that the people in the crowd enjoy the time. However, I could nearly found anyone who dances alone in public here. Being Chinese, I know people here, especially the middle-aged people, are uncomfortable to act differently in public, they feel comfortable when they act alike in a group.

But why? In our childhood, the textbook suggests us to study and to be famous scientists in the future. And we think it’s the only way that can contribute to our motherland. But when we grow up, we found that the goal is too far to achieve because most of us are ordinary, it’s beyond our ability. Maybe some other people will laugh at me, I think, so hiding is an obvious choice for me. When I see that the people around are as ordinary as me, I feel more powerful, even though I know it’s an illusion.

Life is a one time journey, and we have to pretend to be ready.
