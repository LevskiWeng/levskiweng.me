# Please don't misuse the word user-friendly

Thank you Steve Jobs, because of your superior sense of humanity, we have a lot more fun to use the electronic devices such as tablets and mobile phones, and the word user-friendly is more and more used today.  People are curious about how does these genius ideas jump out of the engineers’ head. And it seems that user-friendly has become the only important factor which leads to the industry’s innovation.

However, when we look back to the old days, we bought daily products that are useful. We bought brooms to clean our houses, we bought bottles to hold the water, and the design of those products is “Be useful and simple”, but nowadays I often hear discussions like “Would it be more user-friendly if my app’s splash screen changes dynamically according to the user’s current location?” If your purpose of showing the splash screen is to enhance the identification of your product, and to attract more users’ attention, it’s okay, but I think it’ll be annoying if I launch the app multiple times a day, and you’ll lose your customers in the end. User-friendly is not cheap, I think, especially when we want to win in the long run. Focus on useful features that your product could bring is the only way to be user-friendly.
