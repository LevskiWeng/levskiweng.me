# Could the truth be expressed subjectively ?

These few days, fans of two Chinese mobile phone brands Xiaomi and Meizu, quarrel with each other about whose mobile phone is better, and the founder of [Zealer.com*](http://www.zealer.com) gave his answer through an evaluation video,  and speak highly of Xiaomi. It seems OK apparently, but the CEO of Xiaomi, is an investor of Zealer.com. So fans of Meizu have doubts about the impartiality of the evaluation.

I have no comment on the market position of the two phones, it depends on what you think of it. But in my opinion, the fans of Meizu have fragile hearts. Does our judgement of the realness depend on the words the story teller choose? Is it less credible when the truth, in a manner, is expressed aggressively? Once you have a strong belief in something, you’ll be put in a cage called “Being afraid that someday you’ll be proven to be the world’s biggest idiot”.

If you believe that you’re an expert on something, you’ll probably preach your belief to your acquaintances from time to time, and I think you’d better to choose the words in order to avoid giving offence to the people who hold different point of view. If you tell the whole story too subjectively, others would have doubt about what you said. But I think the wise men will make their own decisions, your words couldn’t have too much influence on them.
