# Each news tells a different story

Because of the boost of social media such as Twitter, Facebook, Weibo and Weixin, news spreads a thousand faster than before. But It’s boring to read the same news in different places. It feels like a waste of time for me. However, it’s interesting that different news sources describe the same event with different words. For example, there’s a hot news in one of the largest Chinese social platform called Weibo right now, the news is about a foreigner who was driving a motorcycle collide with a middle-aged lady. Some witnesses post short Weibo messages, said that the lady extorted the money from the foreigner by pretending being hurt by the motorcycle. But another version of the event is spreading over the internet at the same time, which said that the foreigner who was driving without licence was responsible for the accident, and the money was penalty for it.

The two news describe the procedure of the event almost identically, but they come to the conclusion in opposite directions. Although the traditional media has strict flow of publishing news, the social media works differently, everyone could post messages to describe the event and others have to use their own judgement while reading. The way you choose depends on your attitude towards life. If you prefer choosing your own life, you’ll probably choose the frustrating way to achieve the freedom.
