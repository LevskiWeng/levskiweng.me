# A special salute to Mr. McMurphy

When McMurphy, in the film named “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” both endures and stands witness to the abused power in a ward for the mentally unstable, he stands out and makes a rebellious stance against the evil force. However most of his inmates remain silent and fear to change even if the changes will bring a better life.

“But I tried, didn’t I? God damn it, at least I did that.”, McMurphy said roughly and sadly but no one answered. Frankly speaking, I’m touched by this line and have a better understanding of the phrase “Exhausted Freedom” since then.

“The best thing we can do is go on with our daily routine.” It must be the voice from the devil. Billy was just murdered by the threat of the powerful nurse in the ward, but the nurse, Miss Ratched tells the other patients to act like it never happened. This ridiculous react of the Miss Ratched reveals that the essence of this rotten ward is cruel, hardhearted and lacks of sympathy.

Finally, McMurphy is dead, but Chief, a friend of McMurphy, breaks the windows of the evil ward and runs towards the freedom. Although it’s not the happy ending style, there’s some hope.

Just do it and make it a better world.
