# Is Chinese Medicine dying?

Scholars have debated whether or not the traditional Chinese medicine is a science. Although it’s an open debate, I think we’ve already put too much attention on whether it’s supported by a theory. The question is: could sheltering in a theory protect Chinese medicine from being attacked by others?

What’s the meaning of a theory-based life? A life without any uncertainty, I think. We’re looking for promises that no harm will come to us and the beautiful, repeatedly proven physical theory system seems like our silver bullet. However, is that an illusion? I’m not a fan of Chinese medicine, but I’ve read some books about the core concepts of  it, I noticed that traditional Chinese medicine has a totally differently approach to discover the source of the sickness. In Chinese medicine treatments, the doctors usually diagnose the patients by the biology feedback of the doctors’ hands, eyes and ears, that is to say, they rely on ourselves’ ability to distinguish the slight difference of each patient’s symptom, but the western medicine  doctors believe that only machines won’t tell lies. Which method is better? In my opinion, both of the methods have their own pros and cons. What we could do is not to give a quick answer to such debates before we’ve fully understood the world.
