# Race panic

The tragedy for George Floyd tells some sad truth about the minority groups living in the US. The governments spread the polically correct slogan "All lives matter", but they treat the non-white races unequally in their mind. Giving some spare money in charity cannot be named democracy.

As a comparison, when the novel COVID-19 outbreak began in Feburary 2020, the Wuhan government takes the responsibilities of protecting citizen and shutdown the city. Although we're ordered (not recommanded) to stay home, I could feel that our medical system is working effectively and our brave people are **united** together to fight back.

Well, the event of George Floyd reveals the arrogance and prejustice of the US government, however, when we look a bit deeper, It shows that USA people are not so confident as before. They don't treat the minority groups as 'brothers and sisters'. So they welcome the cheap low-end labors but refuse to give more high-end job opportunities.

We have the most inpiring future, and we've already prepared for all the difficulties and hardships.
