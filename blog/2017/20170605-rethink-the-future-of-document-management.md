# Rethink the future of document management

Today, many **MODERN** cloud-based services attract our attention, such as infrastructure-as-a-service (IAAS), platform-as-a-service (PAAS), and even anything-as-a-service. It seems that we're so eager to outsource them to cut the TCO. 

I'm not going to debate the judgement is right or wrong here, but I'd like to share some of my view in this article. In my point of view, TCO is something that will be emphasized usually when the economy is bad. So it's a not a key of success but a attempt of avoiding failure.

So what is the cloud-based document management for? As a product manager of a private-cloud-based document management system. I've analyse the pros and cons of many potential competitors. They looks similar to each other because the core user requirement is always:

1. Store private documents in the cloud to get them in any time, and from any where.
2. Share documents to others, or do some work with others' help.
Some products emphasize their outstanding market position as a fulltime private cloud-based disk, and others say that they're the best web-based cooperation tools.

Is that it? When I dig a little deeper, I realize that the reason why you save a document is to use it in another day, but you don't know the exact time. So what you'll do when you want to reuse the document?

1. Find the document(s) quickly and painlessly whenever you need.
2. Do what you want without difficulty.

So, what's the next step? That's what I'm thinking about now.
