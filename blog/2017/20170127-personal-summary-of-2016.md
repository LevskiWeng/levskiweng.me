# Personal summary of 2016

In my 2016, the following work has been done:

* Continuous-integation in software development was introduced and integrated by me in a "Class A" project in the company, and the result seemed good.
* Finish a project to optimize the workflow in R&D procedure as a project manager, and the QA gave a "A" score.

But I mess up somthing at the same time:

* Failed in the exam. (Sure, I'm an idiot.)
* Doesn't become smarter than I expected.

In 2017, as a product manager, I've chosen a different way to achieve my goal at work. It's not easy, but I think it fits my talent better. And in my personal life, I would pursuit my happiness altogether with my soul mate who is my wife as well.

The new year to come seems harder because economics growth in China is hard to foresee. However, no one could stop yourself from being successful.
