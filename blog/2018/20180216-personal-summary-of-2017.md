# Personal summary of 2017

The year of 2017 is a tough year for me because the overall profit of the division I'm working for is much less than other 2 divisions, as a newbie product manager, I can feel the pressure around me especially in the second half of the year. When the sales failed to achieve the predicted income or there were urgent tasks that need help, the product managers have to stand out and clear the way.

However, because of information asymmetry between field sales and us, the root causes of the failures can't be revealed each time and I feel helpless at that time. To relief the pain this year, I plan to:

- Read more books about marketing and product management.
- Keep good personal relations with the major field sales

The products that I'm in charge with are very flexible in scale and our sales sometimes get confused. To emphasize the selling point, I'll continue to improve the sales instruction guide.

2018 has arrived, will it be a glory championship or another horrible punch to me?  Let's fight and see.
