# Are robots with human sense a new species ?

Having been the top creature in the food chain for many centries, human is used to the position. To keep us safe and happy, we create machines to do the dirty work, then the robots. The robots do more and more work and we put some sensers on them in order to make them smarter, However, suddenly a voice appears in our head:

    Will the robots finally evolve out of our control, and take the place of human beings?

Some scientists have optimistical attitute toward robotics and believe that everything is under control. However, the public express their anxiety in many ways. There are many films that describe the scenes that smart robots having human feelings are attacking or protecting human beings. That reveals our contration. Well, we’re trouble maker now.

In my opinion, robots today are not a threat, it’s a new way to evolve for us. Species evolvement depends on the nature condition for tens of thoudsands of years,but today we develop a new method of evolvment.

If it’s a common activity to drive cars to extend our living scope, why do we fear of the robots? What we have to do is to take advantage of it carefully.
