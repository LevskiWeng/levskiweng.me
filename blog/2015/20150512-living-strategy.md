# Living strategy

We people all have living strategy. In the modern world, someone earn their living by selling their knowledge and others dig money from manual working. It looks straight-forward, but when I looked back into our history,  a question was raised in my head:

> Who decides the living strategy of our body cells?

The theory of evolution tells us that the better we adapt the world, the longer we survive. And the form of our human body is the result of adapting the change of the world. But I think the theory still couldn’t explain why our body cells want to live longer. Do they have unusual desire to spread the species all over the world?  How could they feel the desire with that simple structure?

Does the “living strategy” of our body cells have impact on our human’s living strategy? I’m afraid I don’t have answers yet, maybe years later, experts of artificial intelligence could give us convincing answers. I’m looking forward to it.
