# Under the dome

A few months earlier, a famous Chinese female journalist named Jing Chai posted a speech video describing the awful air quality current in China, and this video exploded our media and attracted our attention immediately. Sooner the feedback voice was heard and unsurprisingly, the ratio of the supporting and doubting is nearly 50/50.

Well, as a born Chinese, I could remember the blue sky in my childhood, and I become more aware of the change of the air we breath, so I approve her investigating behavior based on my own experience. However, I have some doubt about the accuracy of her data, or, in another word, I doubt about the professionalism of her speech.

As a professional journalist, Mrs. Chai successfully distracted our attention from the decline of the economic grow to our living environment, this step forward deserves our applause. But the data used to support her point of view seemed to lack authority. The living environment in China is getting worse, but we can’t tell the accurate emergency degree. You can’t use a miss-used evidence to convince me of a somewhat right conclusion.

I hope that Mrs. Chai and her team keep working, play a key role in our journalism and make the world better for us, together.
