# Keeping your mouth shut or declaring your opinion ?

I’ve noticed that different people react differently when they’re facing criticism. Someone fight back by giving more examples or evidence to prove they’re right. But the others turn around and leave the objections behind.

Especially in China, some people are fond of making noise when others are discussing topics seriously. I wondered why they feel like making others uncomfortable and now I understand that they try to attract others attention by shitting everywhere.

Debating on what is right or wrong is very helpful to us, but please don’t change the subject to “is it good or bad”.

Don’t waste your time on the noising masses around, keep focusing on your target.
