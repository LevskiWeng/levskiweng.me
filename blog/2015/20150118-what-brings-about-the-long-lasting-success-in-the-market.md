# What brings about the long-lasting success in the market ?

There are tons of books that describe the keys to make a big money, some of them raise examples and call for digging into our unrevealed desire, as Steve Jobs did, and others describe the marvelous detail design of  the Apple’s products to emphasize the importance of industrial design, well, still as Steve Jobs did.

Well, I agree on the principles these books summarized, but I still think we miss something. What makes the monopolistic advantage in the market? Do we prefer something badly or just have no other options? I think it’s not only an economics issue, but also a psychology issue.

Forget the ambition of being success, it’s a side effect. If you keep focusing on providing the excellent services, the customers will simply respond with rewards. The product would hit the market when the kindhearted sole combines with the introverted physical form.
