# Personal summary of 2014

Well, because the last month and the first month of a year are always the busiest time in my company, I write this personal summary of 2014 now. It’s boring to list the shining moments or milestones in my work or life, and this time I want to summarize my 2014 differently.

What did I failed to accomplish in 2014?

1. Failed to win the lottery number twice and didn’t become a millionaire.
2. Too stingy to buy me a titanium road bicycle.
3. Cash in on my annual leave and failed to make a short trip with my wife.
4. Failed to lose some weight to meet my goal.
5. So on…

I wrote the above list with smile, because some items are funny, but the others have warned me that I’m not self-discipline enough sometimes. To be a better man in my career and life, self-discipline is the most important factor.

As a human being, I have many vulnerabilities, but it’s not the excuse for refusing to change.

Wish me a happy new year!
