# Emotion for Taiwan

I watched a documentary film named "Taiwan Province" recently on [bilibili.com](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1su4m1u7gQ/?spm_id_from=333.999.0.0&amp;vd_source=3420ddbb8d422358aee16be4376cdee9), and I have a strong emotion to express. 

We people on mainland China treat the people on this beautiful island as a close family member who has been abroad for many years. Though we've lost contact for many years, I recognized him at first glance when walking on the street. I yelled  "Hi brother" loudly to him, and the vivid memories of the early times between us couldn't help to jump into my mind. However, he was surprised or even embarrassed when I called him "brother".

He said: "We're all grown-up, why are you so eager to clarify our relationship to others publicly?" And I said: "What? I don't mean to clarify anything to others, I just want to share my experiences these years with you, and how have you been these years?"

I still believe in the brotherhood in vein, but do you?
