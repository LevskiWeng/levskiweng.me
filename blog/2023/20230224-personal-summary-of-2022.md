# Personal summary of 2022

Last year is a tough year for everyone in China, but I'm glad that I survive and form a small team to undertake projects. When I looked back, I found that our success rate is lower than 10%. This rate reveals some truths:

1. We put too much effort to the projects which we can't trace the real progress.
2. Our core competitiveness is not outstanding enough to impress the customers.

So, this year, I'll make more efforts to improve the business ability:

1. Reinforce the connections of the customers who already purchased our products and services, and try to win long term contracts.
2. Marketing a SD-IoT business solution for electric automobile parking & charging.

Hope it works.
