# Outsourcing or self-innovation

The short but useless answer to this question is "It depends". The business decision doesn't like math-problem-solving, it doesn't have a **STANDARD** answer. It's more like a strategy-driven game and the answer depends on the goals that you want to achieve.

Every company is a part of one industry supply chain at least, its core advantages over other competitors, called value-added services will never be outsourced. However, competitiveness is volatile due to the rise and fall of the industry and your competitors.

In my opinion, a state-owned company is a market extension of the government in China, so the core advantage of a state-owned company is the business **CREDIT** which is linked to the credit of the P.R.C. When the world economy is struggling, the China government may be the last source of confidence.

A big government doesn't mean that it takes care of everything for everyone. As a result, many state-owned companies subcontract their projects to other private companies. The behavior is hard to blame because it has the responsibility to control the risks and provides its own value-added services. It should take responsibility to gather upstream and downstream business partners, and it's called **whole process management**.

Am I right? I've no idea, but I would like to try.
