# Personal summary of 2015

Well, according to the summary of 2014, many things on the wish list were left undone, but many jobs that didnâ€™t on that list were done.

In 2015, as a project manager, I made some break-through on my work and I need to improve myself in project management and technical skill in 2016.

In my private life, I have some personal goals to achieve, and I wish I have more execution power.

Wish myself a happy new year!
