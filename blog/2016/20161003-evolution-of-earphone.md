# Evolution or Revolution?

The Apple Inc. releases its newest wireless earpod, and argues over its design arised as usual. In my point of view, the design principle of the traditional earphone are as follows:

1. Simplify the design of the **player**
2. Make the **player** affordable

The undocumented rules above are inherited from the TV set, radio set, I think. In those days, ordinary families cannot afford expensive electronic devices. In order to popularize the "modern living", the engineers tried their best to cut the cost of the **player** as much as possible. However, when the prices go down, those design patterns become unsuitable gradually. Finally, we see that the [Apple](www.apple.com) stands out to reinvent the earphone, AGAIN.

Some people think the design of the earpod is terrible because:

1. You have to charge them on occasions
2. Easy to drop, not friendly to sporters

Of course, these bad aspect cannot be neglected, but we have to admit, as a product, every feature comes with a trade off. So I think John Ive chooses the design because it can:

1. simplify the usage of accessories
2. improve the playback quality of the music
3. save the inner space of the phone

It seems that the earpod is merely a tiny step forward, but I think it's a giant step of the **player** market.

Looking forward to the iPhone 8.
