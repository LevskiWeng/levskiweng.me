# Blog host relocation

I'm tired of the spam comments of my previous WordPress blog system. What I want is a simple-clean-static blog system, and no more comments.

I raised this idea at the beginning of this year, but I'm too busy and too lazy to relocate my blog. Finally, I find a cheap VM hosting site called [vultr.com](http://www.vultr.com/?ref=6932836-3B) and I move my entire blog to the new host.

The work flow of updating my blog is:

1. Write a blog file in Markdown style, then commit and push it to [my blog  on github](https://github.com/LevskiWeng/levskiweng.me)
2. The blog system will update the blog every hour automatically
3. After the update, [the blog page](http://levskiweng.me) updates immediately.

The reason why I don't use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or any other existing static blog systems is I found them too heavy to set up. I need a pure 'html-javascript' driven blog system, and I want a private playground of web.

That's it.
