# Be a chief thinking officer

Well, if you’re not curious about the reason why things go this way, you would lose the opportunities to grow stronger in your career life. That’s what I learned after watching <em>The Lost Interview of Steve Jobs</em>. If you rethink the procedure of your workflow, rethink the rules and regulations in your company, you would probably find many ridiculous procedures. They’re redundant and meaningless. The original purpose of the regulations is to write the best practice down and hope to benefit the others. However, when the company grows larger, the regulations are more and more treated  as the defensive weapons which prevent the executors from being blame, what a shame! If we lose the passion, what are the differences between the robots and us?

I don’t like that, exactly
