# Don't blame others for your own decision

Everyday, we have to make lots of decisions such as “Shall I get up or take a snap“, “Read daily gossip or serious news on bus“. Although some decisions are tough to make, most of them cost you only one or two minutes each. However, don’t underestimate those little decision. Your attitude towards the decisions somewhat decides the result. If you have the confidence to announce “The buck stops here”, the problem will not annoy you again, if you just pass the problem to the next one, the problem will be passed back to you at last.

So, don’t blame others for your own decision. It’s yourself, not anyone else, choose to be the one you hate.
