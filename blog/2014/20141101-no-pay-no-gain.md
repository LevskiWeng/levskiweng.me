# No pay, no gain

When we Chinese are talking about why the industry gap between the developed countries (such as the USA) and us is huge, we usually comment sadly “As a developing country, the average technical level of our country falls behind the developed countries more than 10 years.”

However, to be frankly speaking, I think the right question is how does a developed country become a developed country? In Marxist theory, the base determines the superstructure in a one-way relationship. First we have to improve our economy, then the industry itself will catch up with our needs soon. If you don’t want to pay money for others’ effort on the products, the producer won’t be able to offer service to you.

It’s quite fair, but the manufacturers and the consumers have different opinions about the price of the services. The manufacturers always want to make more money from their high quality services by offering products with high quality, but the consumers refuse to pay money for the part of quality which beyonds their needs. Then we raise the question “Who is responsible for the accurate definition of customer requirement, the customer himself or the manufacturer?” I don’t think there’s a short answer to this question, but remember that “Tradeoff is inevitable in our lives”.
