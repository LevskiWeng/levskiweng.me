# Burn to ashes

I read an answer to the question “Is it nonsense that someone lives peacefully without seeking fame or wealth?”(If you could read Chinese, click [here](http://zhi.hu/19P3) to read the original answer). From the time that people are connected by the modern technology, the fame and wealth become the symbol of the winner of life because they could be expressed in numbers easily, and it has a clear answer when comparing two numbers. The life is simplified to a number-comparing game at last.

I admire the millionaires on TV, and I agree that my living standard could be improved if I have more money. But I’m not a slave of money. That is to say, I work for my interests.

I’m not a workaholic, indeed. Though sometimes I brought work home and working till midnight, I won’t give up the opportunity to spend my weekends with my wife and other family members. Push oneself to the edge is a good way to excite one’s potential, but I think it will harm you when you use it too ofter.

Admit it, everyone has his own limits. You could choose the strategy to maximize your strength or minimize your weakness. If you want the both and push yourself too hard, you’ll probably be burned to ashes. We’ve read many stories which have similar woeful endings: a famous and successful business man died in cancer after continuous hard-working for many years.

Please spend more hours with your family, soul-mate, friends. They, not the employers, care about you.
