# Online to offline

Here in China, the Spring Festival, like the Christmas season,  is a you-cannot-miss shopping season. The traders try their best to attract the attention of consumers.  And two of the biggest Internet companies in China want to take the opportunity to popularize their own electronic wallet apps. They promote their online payment methods through commission to the consumer and the trader. And till now, thereâ€™s no sign of easing.

However, the dark side of fierce commercial competition has appeared gradually. The quantity of commission seems more important when sets beside  the quality of the service. And we go back to the old way: being attracted by the material rewards and ignore the spiritual experience.

Online payment is more convenient and offline payment seems more secure. In China, online payment method, as a emerging payment method, needs time to be accepted. I think deploying machines which accept online payment method in super market is a better way to show us the advantage of the online payment.
