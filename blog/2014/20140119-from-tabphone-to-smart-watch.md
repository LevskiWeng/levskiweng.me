# From tabphone to smart watch

It’s interesting that usually human being understands the world spirally. Today, the screen size of the mobile phone breaks our cubicle thinking again and again. On one hand, it reaches almost 7 inches, on the other hand, the smart watch which has only 3 inches display screen becomes a popular idea now.

Big display fits our needs of  information consuming, but small size is better for carrying. Some manufacturers think it’s more important for their customers to use the fragmented pieces of time. But some other manufacturers think their customers care more about the mobility of such devices. At last we have to take a powerful, big mobile phone and a lot of accessories such as bluetooth earphone mic, charger, case and so on, to keep it working all day long. If you forget to take any accessories with you, you’ll get nervous.

It seems that a phone without accessories can’t work well for us and we’re tired of the situation. Then we invent the smart watch and we hope the little accessory could be the all-in-one accessory and simplify our life. But in my opinion, the screen size of mobile devices limits the usability. And the best way to solve the problem is to find a comfortable display size for most of us, and let the rest customers determine the display size by themselves.

It’s a bad idea to force users to adopt accessories of phones, not excepting the smart watch.
