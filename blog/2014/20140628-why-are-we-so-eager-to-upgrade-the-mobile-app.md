# Why are we so eager to upgrade the mobile app ?

Since changing my mobile phone from Blackberry to Android, I often receive more than one app upgrade notifications. I feel happy at first as the notification tells me the update has bundles of new feature and a lot of bug fix. However, I fall into boredom to receive such notifications after a couple of weeks. Being a industry developed at top speed, most of the authors of mobile apps are not so experienced that they often adopt the strategy: release their apps as quickly as possible at first, and then give out series of patches (updates) to enhance the core functions or improve the user experience. The <em>agile development </em>strategy stimulates the users’ expectation of app upgrades. We’re eager to learn new things in order to get rid of the afraid of being left behind.

So, is the software upgrade really that important to us? Think twice, dude.
