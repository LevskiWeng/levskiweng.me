# Do you believe what the experts say ?

Many years ago, the social division of labor eliminates all-round masters gradually and we have to turn to the experts in specified fields for advice. However, no one could promise us that what the experts say is correct. We don’t know who to trust especially when the suggestions given are in opposite direction. While scratching heads, we realize that we have to solve the problem all by ourselves.

Do it and do it right now. We go to the libraries, take courses, search the internet and do our best to try to find the answer. Finally we become the very minority to know the truth.

But wait, I think I’ve seen that before. Oh yes, nearly each Hollywood blockbuster imported here has the same scene like this. The leading actor rejects others’ advice and insists on finding the truth himself. We, the audience, sigh with inward relief then.

Being infatuated with the stories of betraying reveals our  inner anxiety. What we want to express is that whatever you say, we just don’t trust in you.
