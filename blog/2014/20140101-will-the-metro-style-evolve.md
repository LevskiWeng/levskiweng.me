# Will the Metro style evolve ?

I love the principle of the Metro style. It’s clean and direct. But I have to admit that the user experience of the Metro style is less funny than the iOS or Android. We know that making a little surprise sometimes is the best way to attract the users’ attention and clean designs keep the users focus on the contents of information. The content itself and visual effect are twin brothers, they cannot live without each other. The designers, especially the structure designers, have to make a balance of the two. And I think this time the Metro style goes too far. It kicks out all the visual decorations and finally the design looks a little bit crude by users.

I’m happy that Microsoft has noticed this problem and it’s going to enhance the notification area. And I’m really looking forward to a simple but effective way to handle my digital life.
