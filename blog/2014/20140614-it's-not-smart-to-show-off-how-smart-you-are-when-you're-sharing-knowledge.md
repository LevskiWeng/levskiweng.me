# It's not smart to show off how smart you are when you're sharing knowledge

When I’m viewing the Q&A on [zhihu.com](http://www.zhihu.com) (one of the hottest knowledge market sites in Mainland China), I feel frustrated that many answers don’t answer the questions asked. Although I believe that everyone has right to express their mind freely, being a perfectionist, I couldn’t stand up for the nonsense behavior which wastes everyone’s time.

Nothing but the fact itself could help us to explore the world. Talk is cheap, show me the code.
